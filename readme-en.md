*Plan*

1. Achieve formatted output similar to Snap Hutao.
2. Package the Python file into an executable (exe).



*Required Packages*

- json
- time
- requests



*Regarding line breaks*

Default to using "\r\n" of Windows



*Supported Programs*

Currently, I have only attempted the "提瓦特小助手"

< Welcome to more attempts >



*Regarding Snap Hutao*

Currently, there is only an intention to transition to **[Snap Hutao](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao)**

​	Due to the reason that SnapHutao's default timezone is set to UTC+0, while the actual usage is UTC+8 (this assertion requires verification by the team), my approach is to obtain the UTC time and then designate UTC+8 as the new "UTC+0"



*Cause*

I have previously utilized the "提瓦特小助手" and the standard output provided by this program is uigf2.2

Inspired by **[NOWorEVER](https://github.com/NOWorEVER/UIGF2.2--UIGF-4)**
